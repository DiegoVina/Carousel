# Project Overview

For this project, I tried to recreate an animation I saw while browsing for ideas. I failed spectacularly, but I came across a really helpful GitHub repo:

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Cassianosch/programador.cs-reels/tree/master)

It has a bunch of great ideas, including the one I used here. That said, I didn’t just copy and paste everything—I wanted to really understand what I was doing and put my own spin on it.

There’s a lot of math involved that’s still a bit over my head, but I spent a good amount of time figuring out how it all works.
